# Data Science Challenge #6

## Step 0: Review a solution

The solution to Data Science Challenge #5 is included in this repository. Review it before beginning this challenge.

## Step 1: Think about distributions

Look at the histogram of your arrival time data.

Think about some commonly used statistical distributions and look at their probability mass functions and/or probability density functions:

For example:

* [Normal/Gaussian Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution)
* [Exponential Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution)

## Step 2: Fit a distribution

Which of these distributions would be _most likely_ to have generated the data?

Create a program that can generate similar data using `scipy.stats.<distribution>.rvs()`?
