Hey there! I'm working from Seattle for the next few months. 

I am at the Wework building downtown taking Flatiron School's Data Science Program. 

I'm looking forward to the day. It's sunnier than I thought it would be, which mmakes me happy. 

Yesterday I thought about imposter syndrome again and the image of Disney's Mulan came to mind. "Hope he doesn't see right through me". Last Friday I was trying to get into the headspace of going to class full time. It's been a long time since I've been in the classroom for this long of a time. I felt really nervous that I would realize on the first day I didn't belong. 

I talked to a friend of a friend who works as a Director of Data Science in LA. I thought I had known at least the reason I wanted to study data science. Somehow while talking to this girl, I just didn't feel like I knew anything. I didn't feel like I had the vocabulary to talk about what I didn't know. My worst fear was bubbling up -- that this person would think, I can't understand what you're ssaying, you are a fraud. 

After the call I sat there and wondered, should I just accept that I'll be the wworst one in the class? Why should I even go if I thought I knew what I was doing and then just talking about it made me see the holes in my logic? 

Over the weekend, I reflected on other times I tried new things. I had to accept that telling myself I was the worst was a terrible way to start. Instead, I tried to stay present. I thought to myself, if I could just **get there** on the first day, literally arrive, then I could do this. 

Now, it's day two.
